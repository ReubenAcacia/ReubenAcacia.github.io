        <h3>Aims Part 1:</h3>

        <p>The middle has fallen out of the film industry in the 21st century. There are fewer and fewer mid-sized films as studios focus on producing tentpole 
            films which produce the maximum gross. Studio's expect that larger budgets will lead to higher film grosses and therefore higher profits. 
            However, it's not clear that this is the case. </p>

            <h3>Aims Part 2:</h3>
    
            <p>The received wisdom in the modern film industry is that more expensive films are needed to reach the largest international audience.
                 Blockbusters films are becoming a larger share of the box office, 
                accounting for more than half of the domestic (USA and Canada) market last year. The international box office is growing rapidly,
                 in 2021 the Chinese box office overtook the domestic box office. As seen in the map countries with larger GDP's tend to spend more on the cinema. 
                Therefore, as the global souths wealth grows, only the largest and most expensive films will be able to enthuse diverse audiences across globe.
                </thead>
                <br>
                <br>
                However, do larger budgets really result in larger box office, and does this result in larger profits? In this project I aim to analyse
                 the box office of blockbusters and uncover the relationship between larger budgets and the profitability of blockbusters.

    <h3>Conclusions Part 1</h3>

    <p> I've analysed the domestic and international box office of the top 20 blockbusters between 2014 and 2018.
         I found 74% of the variations in domestic box office grosses were due to production costs, a strong relationship.
          The correlation between production costs and international gross was much weaker. This is in contrast to
           Hollywood's belief that larger budgets are needed to appeal to a global audience and suggests other factors 
    may be responsible for a films global success. 
</thead>
<br>
<br>
        High critic scores are thought to improve box office, but do higher budgets improve critic scores? 
        I found no link between the two, implying critic scores are independent of production costs and 
        likely one of the other factors responsible for films box office success.

    <h3>Conclusions Part 2</h3>

    <p>I used a supervised machine learning linear regression to predict the correlation between increased 
        budgets and net profits. The algorithm was trained on my 2014-2018 data. I found an goodness of fit 
        of 0.49, suggesting larger budgets will increase net profits of blockbuster films, but that around half 
        the variation in profits is due to other factors. Further research could identify those other factors 
        which may involve: casting, critic reception, audience reception, marketing techniques and more. </p>
</div>  

<div class="section">
    <h3>Data</h3>

</p>I obtained data from four sources, the World Bank (Chart 3,4,5,6,7,8), Deadline.com (Chart 4,5,6,7,8), 
IMDB (Chart 5) and Box Office Mojo (Chart 1, 2, 3). The data from Deadline.com was accessed via scrapping 
with beautiful soup, I chose this method because Deadline.com doesn't have an API and the data was for a 
fixed time period. Looping scrappers were used to access data on the top 20 films from different years.
 I used the 2014-2018 period because more recent data has been skewed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Including 
 that data would've reduced the ability of my regressions to tell me the correlation for a 'normal' period. 
</p></thead>
    <br>
    <br> </p>
The data from the World Bank was accessed through a beautiful soup scrapper, the data from the World
Bank was used for adjusting for inflation the values of the data from deadline. A major issue with a 
lot of box office analysis is it rarely adjusts for inflation. The metacritic scores were accessed from
 IMDB through a python package IMDbPY. The Box Office Mojo data for charts 1 and 2 was scraped from their 
 website using pandas read_html. For the map I scraped data from their website  using beautiful soup.

         </p>
</div>  

<div class="section">
    <h3>Data Cleanning</h3>

   
Chart 1 and 2 required cleaning the data scraped from Box Office Mojo into a TIDY long form format, I did this
 in python. Then I merged the different data sets in excel, correcting all the figures to three significant
  figures. For Chart 3 my scraper gave me a json file, which I checked the names against with those of my 
  basemap using the technique Dennis showed us. Several of the names didn't match the base map, I manually 
  changed these names as well as the columns as well as the columns to produce my clean data set. World Bank 
  data on GDP was used to used to calculate the national box office used for the map as proportions of national 
  GDP. I did the calculations in excel, as well as cleaning the results to 3 significant figures.
</thead>
    <br>
    <br>
For Chart 4,5,6,7,8 the data from Deadline.com required a little cleaning. My scraper already adjusted 
all the figures for inflation, but the scraper produced the wrong year for several films. For example 
Black Panther was listed as coming out in 2022, the year the sequel was released, I manually changed fixed
 these in excel.
