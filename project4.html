          <h3>Briefing note  –  Employment in the West Midlands and the Plan for Growth</h3>

          <br>
          <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>

                A strong labour market is key to enabling local people, industry and the West Midlands economy to grow and flourish. The West Midlands Plan for Growth builds upon the region’s Strategic Economic Plan and Local Industrial Strategy. Highlighting the key features of the region’s economy, our geographical connectivity, our young and diverse population, our skills profile and business productivity. Through focusing investment in high priority sectors: Arts, Finance, Energy Production, Transport and Science) WMCA can accelerate employment growth.

                <h3> Regional Perspective</h3>

                
                Between 2022 and 2023, employment grew across the wider West Midlands region (Combined Authority, 5 county counties and the Stoke-on-Trent and Telford Unitary Authorities).
                The highest growth rate was in Energy Production, at  almost 9%. Employment grew in the Finance, Scientific and Arts sectors.
                Increasing employment growth in these key growth sectors is crucial for the region’s future.

             <h3>  Constituent Authorities</h3>
             Employment grew in WMCA’s seven constituent members last year. The highest growth rate was Coventry’s 4.2%. 
             The growth was supported through WMCA’s £363 million invested in transport, £88m UK Shared Prosperity Fund investment and £130 million annual Adult Education Budget (in 2020 there was almost a 10% in adults with Level 3 skills).
             WMCA facilitates the conditions for employment growth and prosperity created by the private sector.

        <h3>  Plan for Growth</h3>
        The region was the fastest-growing outside London from 2010 to 2019. Our industrial mix and demography resulted in significant economic hardship as result of Covid pandemic and increased trade frictions since 2019. In 2020 GVA fell in most Plan for Growth sectors across the combined authority. There isn’t data available on the effects of falling GVA on employment in priority sectors at the local authority level. Given the strong correlation between falling GVA and lowered employment levels at the regional level, it’s likely there was also significant contraction in employment in priority sectors in 2020.

        <h3>  Challenges Post-COVID</h3>
        The region was the fastest-growing outside London from 2010 to 2019. Our industrial mix and demography resulted in significant economic hardship as result of Covid pandemic and increased trade frictions since 2019. In 2020 GVA fell in most Plan for Growth sectors across the combined authority. There isn’t data available to show the effects of falling GVA on employment in priority sectors at the local authority level. Given the strong correlation between falling GVA and lowered employment levels at the regional level, it’s likely there was also significant contraction in employment in priority sectors in 2019. <br>      <br>
        Research by Oxford Economics predicts a yearly growth rate of 1.16% for the West Midlands between 2019 and 2040. The national growth rate was predicted to be 1.35%, without improvement the region will grow below the national average for the next two decades. Causing a negative effect on earnings and employment across the region.

        <h3>  Future developments</h3>
        “Our Plan for Growth aims to increase opportunities and jobs throughout the region by driving forward economic growth and creating the right conditions for investment and prosperity.” - Jamie Elliott, Delivery Manager at the WMCA <br>      <br>
        WMCA has conducted detailed analysis of how to incubate market conditions to create a credible path for above forecast growth and job creation. The authority plans to achieve £3.9bn of additional output above the forecast by 2030, the West Midlands will be the highest growing region outside London. Employment levels have increased in the last year, vacancies are at their highest level recorded and unemployment is below pre-pandemic levels. WMCA will use its unique leadership position to enhance the region’s economic and job growth through targeted investments to support business growth in priority sectors.
